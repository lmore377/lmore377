## Hey, I'm Elle! 
I'm a self taught hardware and software hacker/developer who's main focus is on trying to make things better/easier for myself and others. 

I'm mainly proficient in Python but I have some knowledge in other languages such as C++, Rust and JavaScript.

My first big project was [MoSlime](https://github.com/moslime/moslime) and my current project is [unnamed-superbird-connector](https://github.com/Car-Thing-Hax-Community/unnamed-superbird-connector).

If you'd like to reach out, the best place to do that would be my Discord (@lmore377) or you could also try my Twitter/X (also [@lmore377](https://x.com/lmore377))
